    "about": "Contextual multi-armed bandits (Contextual MAB) can be valuable in supply-chain optimization in e-commerce. Contextual MAB algorithms combine the benefits of multi-armed bandits (MAB) and contextual information to make more informed decisions and optimize the supply chain. Here's how Contextual MAB can help in supply-chain optimization in e-commerce:",
